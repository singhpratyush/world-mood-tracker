### Development Guide

The app uses `yarn` as package manager so you should have it installed (along with `nodejs`) in order to develop the app further.

To run the app, you can simply type `yarn dev` in a terminal and open the indicated URL on a web browser. Any changes you make in the code would be instantly reflected in the browser window.

To bundle the application, run `yarn build`. It uses `webpack` build in the background, generating `index_bundle.js` and `index.html` in the process. Please make sure you add these files to `git` whenever there is a change.

Also, add `yarn.lock` to `git` whenever you add/remove some package.

Happy Coding!
